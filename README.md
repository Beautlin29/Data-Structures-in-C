# Data Structures in C

This repository contains a collection of programs that I have practiced for learning Data Structures in C. The programs cover various data structures and their implementations in C.

## Study Material

To supplement the practice, I have referred to a helpful study material available on YouTube. The study material includes a playlist of videos that provide in-depth explanations and tutorials on Data Structures in C. You can find the study material [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo5W4Nhv31bbKJzrsKfMpo_grxuLl8LU).

## Why Practice?

Practicing is considered one of the best ways to learn and reinforce concepts related to Data Structures and Algorithms. By implementing the programs in this repository, I have gained hands-on experience and a better understanding of various data structures in C.

Feel free to explore the programs and use them as a reference or learning resource. I hope they can be helpful in your journey to mastering Data Structures in C.

Happy coding!
